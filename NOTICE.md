## Body diagram geometry

The muscle outlines the body maps are drawn from (`frontend/src/lib/body-paths.js`) are derived
from [**MuscleMap**](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap) by Melih Colpan, used under the
**MIT License** and reproduced below. MuscleMap ships its path data as Swift source rather than
`.svg` files; the paths were converted to a JSON module, its sub-group shapes were dropped, and
nothing else about the artwork was changed.

## Exercise data & media

Fit Pro Player obtains both through
[**hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset**](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset), which
licenses them differently. Neither is covered by Fit Pro Player's AGPL license.

That dataset is itself a redistribution: the content originates from
[**ExerciseDB v1**](https://exercisedb.dev/) by **AscendAPI**. This is verifiable from Fit Pro Player's
own data — the stored media filenames embed ExerciseDB's `exerciseId` (Fit Pro Player's `0001` is
`0001-2gPfomN.jpg`; `2gPfomN` is ExerciseDB's id for "3/4 sit-up"), every metadata field matches,
and the instruction sentences are identical apart from stripped `Step:N ` prefixes. See
[issue #5](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset/issues/5) on that dataset.

### Metadata & instruction text

The exercise names, attributes and instructions (English in `frontend/src/lib/exercises-data.js`,
other languages in `frontend/src/instr/`, regenerated via `scripts/build-instructions.mjs`)
originate from ExerciseDB v1 and reach Fit Pro Player through the dataset above, which distributes them
under the MIT license reproduced below. The translations into languages other than English are
Fit Pro Player's own derivative work and are covered by Fit Pro Player's AGPL.

### Images & animations — third-party, not MIT and not AGPL

The exercise thumbnails (180×180) and animations are **not** covered by the MIT license above and
**not** by Fit Pro Player's AGPL. Their ownership is currently **unresolved**, and Fit Pro Player states this
plainly rather than guessing:

- The upstream dataset attributes them to **© [Gym visual](https://gymvisual.com/)**, redistributed
  there with that rights holder's written permission — a permission granted to *that dataset* and
  **not transferable**.
- **ExerciseDB/AscendAPI** describes itself as "the original creator and owner" of this content and
  publishes its own [terms](https://exercisedb.io/faq), which permit self-hosting, bundling and
  commercial display, while prohibiting redistribution of the raw dataset or media as a standalone
  or competing content package.

These two claims contradict each other. A clarification has been requested from AscendAPI; this
notice will be updated once the provenance is settled.

**Until then, treat the media as third-party content licensed to neither Fit Pro Player nor to you.**

**Fit Pro Player does not redistribute it.** It is not in this repository, not in its history, and not in
the published container images or the Android APK. A self-hosted instance downloads it from the
upstream source on first `docker compose up`; the mobile and demo builds load it from a CDN at
runtime.

If you want to reuse the media — in Fit Pro Player or anywhere else, commercially or not — **clear it with
the rights holder first**, and keep any attribution that accompanies it intact.
